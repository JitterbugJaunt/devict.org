# Support

Membership in our organization is free as are most of our events. To keep our
services free we depend on donations from the community. To that end there are
multiple ways to support us.

<h2>Donate Via PayPal</h2>
<p>
  If you have a PayPal account and wish to make either a one-time or monthly
  donation you can do that here: PayPal will collect 2.9% plus $0.30 of your
  donation.

<h2>Donate Via Patreon</h2>
<p>
  If you do not have a PayPal account you can create a recurring donation via
  Patreon. The fees they take are higher than PayPal but you don't have to have
  a PayPal account.
